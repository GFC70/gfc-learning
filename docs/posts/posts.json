The text showing the data table can appear\r\nsmall to those with visual difficulties. Even for those without\r\ndifficulties, the size of the text can prove problematic at times.\r\nTo increase the size of the text shown in the editor window, use the\r\nkey combinations of\r\nCTRL SHIFT + to zoom in\r\nCTRL SHIFT - to zoom out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

There will also be posts using R showing\r\nhow I have been using it for data transformations and data\r\nvisulisations.\r\n\r\nThis website was built completely in R using the distill\r\npackage.
